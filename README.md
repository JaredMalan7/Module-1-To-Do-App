# To-Do-App

## Overview

The To-Do List Application is a simple web-based application built to help users manage their tasks effectively. Users can:
* Add new tasks.
* Mark tasks as completed.
* Remove tasks from the list.

This project demonstrates my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic UI updates.

## Development Environment

* Editor: Visual Studio Code
* Version Control: Git and GitHub
* Languages and Technologies:
* HTML: Provides the structure for the web page.
* CSS: Used to style the application and enhance the user interface.
* JavaScript: Handles the core functionality for adding, marking, and removing tasks dynamically.

## Features

1. Add Task:
    * Users can type a task in the input field and click "Add Task" to add it to the list.
   
2. Mark Task as Complete:
    * Clicking on a task toggles its "completed" state, which visually changes its appearance.

3. Remove Task:
    * Each task has a "Remove" button, allowing users to delete it from the list.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/JaredMalan7/Module-1-To-Do-App.git

2. Open the project folder in your preferred editor.
3. Open the index.html file in any modern web browser to view application. (live view extensions may be used as well).

## Future Enhancements
The following features will be added in future iterations as part of Stretch Challenges:
1. Data Persistence: Save tasks making use of the local storage
2. Task Filtering: Add options to filter tasks by "completed" and "incomplete".
3. Drag-and-Drop Reordering: Allow users to reorder tasks dynamically.
